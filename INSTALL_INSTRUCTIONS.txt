GAME TEXT TRANSLATOR - INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
================================================

Since you can't use terminal commands, here are the simple steps to get started:

METHOD 1: EASY LAUNCHER (RECOMMENDED)
=====================================
1. Double-click on "run.bat" file
2. This will automatically:
   - Check if Python is installed
   - Install required packages
   - Try to build the C++ optimization module
   - Launch the program

METHOD 2: MANUAL LAUNCHER
=========================
1. Open Python IDLE or any Python environment
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: python launcher.py
4. Follow the on-screen instructions

METHOD 3: DIRECT RUN (IF OTHERS FAIL)
=====================================
1. Open Python IDLE or any Python environment
2. Navigate to this folder
3. Run: python game_translator.py
4. The program will work in Python-only mode (still fast!)

WHAT THE PROGRAM DOES
=====================
- Extracts text from game files in folders and subfolders
- Organizes text into chunks of less than 1000 characters
- Provides a GUI for translating the extracted text
- Can apply translations back to the original files
- Works with Python, C++, JavaScript, XML, JSON, and many other file types

FILES IN THIS PACKAGE
=====================
- launcher.py          - Easy setup and launch program
- game_translator.py   - Main translation program
- text_extractor.cpp   - C++ optimization module (optional)
- setup.py            - Build configuration
- requirements.txt    - Python dependencies
- run.bat             - Windows launcher script
- README.md           - Detailed documentation

TROUBLESHOOTING
===============
If you get errors:

1. "Python not found" - Install Python from python.org
2. "Module not found" - Run the launcher first to install dependencies
3. "Permission denied" - Run as administrator or choose a different folder
4. "No texts found" - Make sure your source folder contains code files

The program will work even if the C++ module can't be built - it just won't be as fast.
